### Sit allocation in a class

**Summary:**
The seating arrangement can significantly influence the outcome of learning experiences. Achieving randomness in a round table context is crucial not only for promoting equity but also for fostering new combinations of knowledge and interactions within a group. However, setting up a random environment can be challenging. This computational notebook presents a method for distributing students randomly using the network analysis library NetworkX to create the seating arrangement.

**Key Features:**
1. **Random Distribution:** The notebook offers a method to distribute students randomly at the round table without considering any specific characteristics.
2. **Balanced Randomness:** Another option provided is to achieve randomness while ensuring that individuals from different groups are seated next to each other. This setting could be useful, for instance, when seating PhD students alongside Master or Research students.
3. **Handling Unbalanced Groups:** The notebook also explores an unbalanced scenario where there are more students in one group than the other. Despite the complexity, a solution is provided to accommodate this situation effectively.
