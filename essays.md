# Essays

This section presents my thoughts in short essays. Normally, these are shorter than 1,000 words. They communicate my beliefs, ideology, feelings, sometimes poetry, and other ideas. This is the part of the web dedicated to Other Arts. But because I sometimes have short thoughts on economics and geography, don't feel weird if you find something on geography or economics here too.
