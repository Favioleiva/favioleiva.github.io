## 🪑 Sit Allocation in a Class

The seating arrangement can significantly influence the outcome of learning experiences. Achieving randomness in a round table context is crucial not only for promoting equity but also for fostering new combinations of knowledge and interactions within a group.  
However, setting up a random environment can be challenging. This computational notebook presents a method for distributing students randomly using the network analysis library **NetworkX** to create the seating arrangement.

- **🎲 Random Distribution:**  
  The notebook offers a method to distribute students randomly at the round table without considering any specific characteristics.

- **🧩 Balanced Randomness:**  
  Another option provided is to achieve randomness while ensuring that individuals from different groups are seated next to each other. This setting could be useful, for instance, when seating PhD students alongside Master or Research students.

- **⚖️ Handling Unbalanced Groups:**  
  The notebook also explores an unbalanced scenario where there are more students in one group than the other. Despite the complexity, a solution is provided to accommodate this situation effectively.

## 🤝 Round Robin Dynamics Applied to Education

The Round Robin method, rooted in tournament scheduling, offers a compelling strategy to enhance classroom interaction and inclusion.  
By ensuring that each student is paired with every other exactly once, it breaks down social barriers and fosters empathy through structured conversations.

- **🧮 Algorithmic Scheduling:**  
  The notebook implements a **1-factorization algorithm** to efficiently generate all possible unique pairings for an even number of students.

- **🌀 Visualizing Interaction Rounds:**  
  For a class of 18, all 17 pairing rounds are visualized, providing a clear overview of the rotation process.

- **🏫 Classroom Impact:**  
  This method can be used for icebreakers, group discussions, or peer reviews—encouraging diverse voices and deeper connections.
