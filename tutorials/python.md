## 1. How to extract data from a PDF using Tabula

Start by installing Tabula for Python (tabula-py) and, if your PDF is large, consider organizing it into sections. Then, load a section into Tabula, select the table area, and choose the extraction mode (*stream* or *lattice*) based on the format. Export as CSV and tidy up the columns in Excel if needed.
