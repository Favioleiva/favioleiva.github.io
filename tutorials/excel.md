## 1. How to unpivot a table using Power Query in Excel
In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to unpivot a table using an example dataset from Seminario, Zegarra and Palomino (2019). The dataset includes variables like population by region, GDP per capita, and more. I show the process of transforming the pivoted data into an unpivoted version, simplifying it to have one column for the year and one for the variable. No specific action is requested from viewers, just a walkthrough of the unpivoting process.
