## 4. Redatam7: Fast operations using the "Frequencies", the "Ribbon" and "Code using Programs": Indigenous Nations, Spoken Languages and Gender
In this tutorial, the speaker demonstrates how to perform fast operations with Redatam, a data analysis tool, using a Bolivian census dataset. He starts by showing how to find and analyze information about the distribution of genders, with more women than men in the census. Then, he explores the first language people learned to speak, highlighting the prevalence of Spanish, Aymara, and Quechua. The speaker also mentions the presence of other languages, such as German, Chinese, and Japanese. He expresses his appreciation for the quality of the Bolivian census data and discusses the potential for further analysis, such as housing types. The tutorial concludes with a brief explanation of how to save the data in an Excel format for further exploration.

Three key points:
- The tutorial covers analyzing gender distribution and the first language learned in the Bolivian census dataset.
- It highlights the prevalence of Spanish and other languages like Aymara and Quechua as the first languages learned.
- The speaker mentions the potential for further analysis, particularly related to housing types in the census data.
- The speaker also teaches how to use the Ribbon and Code in Programs, how to save these programs in each project and performs an analysis on Indigenous Nations, Spoken Languages and Gender in Bolivia.

Watch the [fourth video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/201a2be2c9ed42a1b5a27e3f41963c56?sid=20860159-96f1-4e78-b7cf-21d37eb9cf04).

## 5. Redatam7: Crosstabs of Indigenous Nations and Gender
In this tutorial, the speaker introduces the concept of cross tabulations, explaining that they can be found in the statistical processor ribbon. He demonstrates how to create a cross tabulation of variables, such as indigenous population and gender, and how to identify those not belonging to any indigenous group. The tutorial provides a program example for generating cross tabulations and exports the results to Excel. The tutorial concludes by highlighting the output files created.

Three key points:
- The tutorial covers the use of cross tabulations in statistical analysis.
- It demonstrates creating cross tables for variables like indigenous population and gender.
- It provides a program example and shows how to export the results to Excel.

Watch the [fifth video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/db7bfd8d83644973a5559275f26626f4?sid=bbff5526-0724-499e-b3d3-beadc9c1a330).

## 6. Redatam7: Arealist - Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Bolivia
In this tutorial, he demonstrates how to represent variables at the district or municipality level using a statistical processor called Arealist, with a focus on working with a single variable and a disclaimer that this method does not apply to crosstabs. He walks through the process, using the example of variable p29c for Bolivia in 2019, illustrating how to split the output at the municipality level and add the municipality names for clarity. He mentions his intention to use this data to create an ethnic map for a Bolivian project, highlighting the need for additional variables for those not identifying as indigenous. He saves the program as "Bolivian Program 5: Bolivian Nations by Municipality" and switches the analysis to variable p29a, including output area names for non-indigenous and non-Bolivian populations. The tutorial concludes with a plan to work with the data in GIS and write a brief article.

Three key points:
- He demonstrates representing variables at the municipality level using Arealist.
- Emphasizes the importance of working with one variable and not crosstabs.
- Intention to create an ethnic map for Bolivia and the consideration of missing variables for non-indigenous populations in question P29C which should be fixed with P29A.

Watch the [sixth video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/3b2eba1198d34e0c9292a33c91958a0b?sid=a8e1893f-e671-43a3-9ffd-1319ff9cc8c5).

## 7. Redatam7: Adding Filters to Frequency Tables and Crosstables
In this tutorial, he teaches how to add filters to frequency tables and cross-tables in the statistical processor. He starts by demonstrating how to filter a frequency table using the example variable B29C, specifying the filter condition, and displaying the filtered data. Then, he moves on to a cross-table analysis by selecting a relevant variable, adding a filter for females, and creating a cross-tabulation between indigenous nations and job categories. He emphasizes the value of this analysis in understanding the distribution of job categories among indigenous groups, particularly female-owned businesses. He saves the results as "Bolivia 4" and highlights the importance of considering individuals who do not identify as indigenous in the analysis.

Three key points:
- Teaches how to add filters to frequency tables and cross-tables.
- Demonstrates filtering for female-specific data analysis.
- Highlights the significance of considering non-indigenous individuals and the potential for generating new variables for comprehensive analysis.
